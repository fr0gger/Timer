# Portable Gym Timer
I created a portable gym timer. You can read the whole process of creation here https://tomrocc.medium.com/from-idea-to-prototype-8fb2aac1178f?sk=cb68b2c0987ea5621828a1683279f179. Some part of code also comes from [this project.](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Garage-Gym-Timer/) 

The timer uses 4 buttons, reset, select, plus and minus. First it will print a "m" for "menu". You can then select among the 4 programs. Whe you select a specific program you can select the number "nb".

## Material
* Arduino Uno for the initial version
